        <em>Restaurants</em> have been around in some form for most of human
        civilization. But they usually catered to travelers. As far back as
        ancient Greece and Rome, inns and taverns generally served food to
        people who had a reason to be away from home. This trend continued until
        relatively recently. Although taverns and

        houses were popular places to gather and share beverages in the 17th
        century, the idea of eating out for fun didn't take off in Western
        society until the late 18th century.

        Although <strong>McDonald</strong>'s was the first restaurant to use the
        assembly-line system, some people think of White Castle as the first
        fast-food chain. White Castle was founded in 1921 in Wichita, Kansas. At
        the time, most people considered the burgers sold at fairs, circuses,
        lunch counters and carts to be low-quality. Many people thought
        hamburger came from slaughterhouse scraps and spoiled meat.
      </p>

      <p>
        White Castle's founders decided to change the public's perception of
        hamburgers. They built their restaurants so that customers could see the
        food being prepared. They painted the buildings white and even chose a
        name that suggested cleanliness. White Castle was most popular in the
        American East and Midwest, but its success helped give hamburger meat a
        better reputation nationwide. So, like cars, White Castle played an
        important part in the development of fast food.

        The McDonald brothers opened their redesigned restaurant in 1948, and
        several fast-food chains that exist today opened soon after. Burger King
        and Taco Bell got their start in the 1950s, and Wendy's opened in 1969.
        Some chains, like Carl's Jr., KFC and Jack in the Box, existed before
        the Speedee Service System, but modified their cooking techniques after
        its debut. McDonald's, which started it all, is now the world's largest
        fast-food chain.

      <p>
        According to the National Restaurant Association, American sales of fast
        food totaled $163.5 billion in 2005 [ref]. The industry is growing
        globally as well. Total sales for McDonald's grew 5.6 percent in 2005,
        and the company now has 30,000 franchised stores in more than 120
        countries.
      </p>

        However, McDonald's - and fast food in general - does not always get a
        welcoming reception around the world. McDonald's restaurants have been
        attacked in several countries, including the United States, China,
        Belgium, Holland, India, Russia, Sweden and the U.K. Protestors have
        accused McDonald's and other chains of selling unhealthy food, marketing
        aggressively to children and undermining local values and culture.
