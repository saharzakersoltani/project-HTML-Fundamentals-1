      <h3><em>History of Fast Food</em></h3>
      <p>
        While the concept of eating outside of the home has been around for
        centuries, the fast food industry as we know it did not get its start
        until the post-WWII American economic boom. Americans began to spend
        more and buy more as the economy boomed and a culture of consumerism
        bloomed. As a result of this new desire to have it all, coupled with the
        strides made by women while the men were away, both members of the
        household began to work outside the home. Eating out, which had
        previously been considered a luxury, became a common occurrence and then
        a necessity. Workers, and working families, needed quick service and
        inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner. This need is what drove the
        phenomenal success of the early fast food giants, which catered to the
        family on the go.
